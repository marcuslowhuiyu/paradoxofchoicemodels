# Paradox of Choice Models
Models used in my project report on the Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz

Model 1: 
A simple model used to differentiate between maximisers and satisficers

Model 2:
Factors in time limit to the agent's decision making
By the end of the time limit, agent must come to a decision

Model 3: 
Factored opportunity cost to calculation
Each choice is now divided into its upsides and downsides
When a choice is made by the agent, the upsides of the other choices forgoed by the agent is factored in
Assumptions: 
•	Agents only notice the upsides of the choices they forego, but are blind to their downsides
•	Agents are aware of the both the upsides and the downsides of the choice they made
•	Each choice is a net positive (i.e., the downsides cannot outweigh the upsides)
•	There is always upsides and downsides to every choice (i.e., neither value can be < 0)
•	The satisficing agent does not incur opportunity cost of choices they never analysed

Model 4:
Factors in escalation of expectations
As the number of choices increases, so too does the expected satisfication of the agent
The difference between the agent's expectation and the actual satisfication of the choice they made is factored in
